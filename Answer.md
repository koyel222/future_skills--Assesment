1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram.
ans : 
The category_id field in the "Product" schema corresponds to the id field in the "Product_category" schema.
Each product in the "Product" schema is associated with one category from the "Product_category" schema.
The category_id in the "Product" schema serves as a foreign key that establishes the connection between the two tables.
This relationship allows you to organize and categorize products.

2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?
Ans: 
To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you would typically rely on a foreign key constraint. In a relational database, a foreign key is a field that refers to the primary key in another table.

In this context, the "Product" table has a column called category_id, which is a foreign key referencing the id column in the "Product_category" table. This establishes a relationship between the two tables.

The foreign key constraint ensures that a value entered in the category_id column of the "Product" table must already exist as a primary key in the "Product_category" table. In simpler terms, you cannot assign a category to a product if that category doesn't exist in the "Product_category" table.

This mechanism helps maintain referential integrity in the database, preventing orphaned records and ensuring that each product is associated with a valid and existing category. If someone tries to insert a product with a category_id that doesn't exist in the "Product_category" table, the database would reject the operation, preserving the consistency and validity of the data.
